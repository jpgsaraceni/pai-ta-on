# Python (pai tรก on)

Study repo for learning python basics.
Based on [PYTHON.LAND tutorial](https://python.land/).

## Getting started

Python3 is native to most Linux systems.
You can check your version by running `python3 --version`.

If you use Windows, just stop.

On MacOS you can get it with homebrew by running `brew install python`.

Python is a kinda interpreted language (internally it compiles to a _bytecode_ of sorts, but you can not care and just run it as if interpreted).
So, to run a python source code you can just run `python3 <NAME_OF_YOUR_SOURCE_CODE_FILE>`, or press a button on your IDE.
